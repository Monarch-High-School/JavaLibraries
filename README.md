## Overview
This Java class was developed for introductory AP Computer Science A students to start a first project in graphics programming without having to learn the nuances of the AWT library. The goal is to expose an easier to use set of methods that will generate simple shapes in a more intuitive way. 

The class utilizes JFree organization's SVG library so that the output can be in raster instead of vector format.

## Building and Usage
We did not use a traditional project file structure in this repo. 
To build the `.jar` file, just run the `build.sh` file from the command line.
Make sure to drop the `.jar` file in your classpath.
In your code, add
```java
import org.bvsd.mohi.*;
```
## Testing
To test the methods create an instance of `MoHiGraphicsTester` and call the `.test()` method to generate a series of shape files.
