# BVSD Image Project
This Github repository comprises three classes that facilitate using the BufferedImage class in Java's AWT library. 
There is an Image class, which represents an image, a Pixel class, which is used for individual pixels, and a Filter class that is used to apply effects to images. See the Javadoc documentation for details.
